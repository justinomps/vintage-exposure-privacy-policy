Privacy Policy for DECO-LUX

Last Updated: [Insert Date, e.g., October 26, 2023]

This Privacy Policy describes how DECO-LUX (the "App") operates and outlines our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the App.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We DO NOT Collect

DECO-LUX is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from your device, such as:

Your name, email address, phone number, or other contact details.

Your location data.

Unique device identifiers that could be linked back to you.

Any photos or media from your device.

Any usage data or analytics that could identify you.

2. Information We DO Collect (Non-Personal Device Data for App Functionality)

To provide the core functionality of DECO-LUX, the App requires access to certain device features:

Camera Access (for Light Metering): The App requires access to your device's camera to utilize its light sensor for exposure calculations. This access is solely used to read light levels from your environment and is processed locally on your device. No images or video are recorded, stored, or transmitted by DECO-LUX.

Locally Stored Settings and User-Generated Data: The App stores data relevant to its functionality exclusively on your device. This includes:

Custom camera profiles (e.g., non-standard apertures, shutter speeds).

Calibration settings for your device's light sensor.

Your preferred settings within the App.
This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties. If you uninstall the App, this locally stored data may be deleted.

3. Third-Party Services

DECO-LUX does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

4. Data Security

Since DECO-LUX does not collect or transmit any personal data, the risks associated with data breaches are significantly minimized in relation to our App. Any data relevant to the App's functionality is stored exclusively on your device, and its security is subject to the security of your device itself.

5. Children's Privacy

DECO-LUX does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
